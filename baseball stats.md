## Player A

According to his UZR and DRS, Player A is not an excellent third baseman according to his UZR, but 

Player A is a much stronger hitter than Player B by creating more home runs and a higher OBP. His wRC+ is fairly higher, which indicates he will create more runs in any playing environment.

Luke Hoey says 

- player B because youre only giving up 17 wrc+ points but plays a more prominent position at center field (and more reliable) with more flexibility (other outfield positions + DH) than player A. 
- Player A hits for more power and sticks out in the lineup, but the OBP is only 10 points higher despite a better batting average
- They are both good hitters, so player B is a better player because of his utility
- Stolen bases is a weak signal 
- BABIP is more robust and Player B is better here
- Overall, you're not giving up very much offensive output by taking Player B for a much versatile
